## About

This iOS app is a proof-of-concept for an architecture which allows for holistic integration testing. This is achieved by injecting dependencies for things which the app does not control. This includes things like: date providing, network responses, user taps, device orientation, and location.

This architecture is heavily based off of learnings while working on the [Nova Sleep Coach](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nova-sleep-coach-from-lumosity/id1010863569) app with [@baek-jinoo](https://github.com/baek-jinoo).
